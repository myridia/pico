Okay, here's a `README.md` file tailored for the Pico project on GitHub (https://github.com/myridia/pico).  I'll make some assumptions based on the name "Pico" and general project structure, but you'll need to fill in the specifics to make it truly accurate.  I'll focus on making it a good starting point.
